# Parallel Systems Lab (Winter Semester 2017/18)

Course Material for the UIBK Parallel Systems Lab will be provided in this repository.

## Topics:

 - Shared memory parallelization (OpenMP + more)
 - Performance-oriented programming
 - Correct benchmarking
 - Distributed memory parallelization (MPI)
 - Dependence analysis (Real codes)
 - Tools (Profilers, sequential and parallel)
 
**All code will be written in C++.**
(Note: this refers to *application* code - scripts for e.g. performing benchmark runs may be written in any suitable language)

Exercises should be tracked on some **git repository**, and **access to that repo should be provided to Peter**. The exercises need to be completed in time for each weeks' lab.

Exercises should be completed in **groups of 2-3 students**. 
**Grades** are based on the regular presentations of solutions, and **Q&A during these presentations**.
